# folder-sizes
This is a short python script I wrote that will take a folder path as an argument and list the total size of each folder within the specified directory. I use this when cleaning out my pc, since windows does not provide this natively unless you check the properties of a given file.

This can be run at the command line via:
"py folder_sizes.py "C:\FilePath"
